# pyclock
A clock with the Raspberry Pi 3 and a touch screen.

Matrix code borrowed and modified from Dylan J. Raub (dylanjraub)

Uses a Raspberry Pi 3 and the Tontec touch screen case:

Script requires root privileges to run. This is definitely some unoptimized maybe less than alpha code, so it's ugly. You were warned.
